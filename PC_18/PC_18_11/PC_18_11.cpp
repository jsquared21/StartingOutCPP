/*
Balanced Multiple Delimiters
A string may use more than one type of delimiter to bracket information into “blocks.”
For example, A string may use braces { }, parentheses ( ), and brackets [ ] as delimiters. A
string is properly delimited if each right delimiter is matched with a preceding left delimiter
of the same type in such a way that the either the resulting blocks of information are disjoint,
or one of them is completely nested within the other. Write a program that uses a single
stack to check whether a string containing braces, parentheses, and brackets is properly
delimited.
